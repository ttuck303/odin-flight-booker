Questions:

How to structure flight - airport relationship?
	- a flight has two airports, origin and destination, so probably either has_one or belongs to
	- an airport has many flights
		- these flights are either leaving or arriving
	- the unique combination is origin * destination * date * time * airline
	- airline has many flights
	- flight has one plane
	- plane has a certain number of seats


May be going overboard here. Reiterating the design requirements:

"A typical airline booking flow:

Enter desired dates / airports and click "Search"
Choose from among a list of eligible flights
Enter passenger information for all passengers
Enter billing information
"
